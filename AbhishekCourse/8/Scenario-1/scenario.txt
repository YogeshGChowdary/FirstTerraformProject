1.Already have Infra on AWS, how will you import the configuration entirely to terraform using import command

2. create main.tf with empty resource block

3.provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
  }

  resource "aws_instance" "scenario-1" {
    
  }

4. and in terminal run commands as below
   "terraform init" 

  "terraform import aws_instance.scenario-1 i-0eedec6b2e6b81b0f"
  
here instance id copy from console, which you want to import to terraform
