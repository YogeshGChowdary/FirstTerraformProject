Resource Drift:

resource/infra created in AWS manually which terraform is not aware of

1. create ec2 instance from terraform
2. update ec2 instance in aws console (like add addl. tags)
3. now resource in AWS is not in sync with local terraform tf.state.. this is called Drift
4. run "terraform plan -refresh-only" --> to see what are changes
5. run "terraform apply -refresh-only" --> to apply the changes
6. once refresh apply command is run, now local terraform is in sync with resource in AWS


terraform refresh will pull the changes that are manually done in console

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. To replace the resource, assume one of ec2 instance is corrupted and you want to replace it, use the command below
2. terraform plan -replace="aws_instance.test_drift" -out test_drift
3. instance script as below... replace the respective attributes in command above

resource "aws_instance" "test_drift" {
  ami = "ami-04b70fa74e45c3917"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "web-app"
    Kind = "httpd-server"
  }
}

4. to apply the changes run the command below
terraform apply "test_drift"
remember-> when running terraform apply now, it won't ask for confirmation
